# Educational Ransomware (Simulation)

This project is a **controlled ransomware simulation** created strictly for
educational purposes as part of a cybersecurity training/induction exercise.

It demonstrates the **basic workflow of ransomware** file enumeration,
encryption, ransom note creation, and recovery without any real-world
malicious behavior.

## Key Characteristics
- Runs only on a user-specified test directory
- Uses symmetric encryption for demonstration
- Appends a custom extension to encrypted files
- Includes a decryptor to restore all files
- No persistence, propagation, or network activity

## Disclaimer
This code is for **learning and defensive research only**.
Run it only in isolated environments (VMs, test folders).
Misuse is strictly prohibited.
